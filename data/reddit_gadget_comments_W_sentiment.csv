22,"For $15,000, GrayKey box promises to crack iPhone passcodes for police",1546,"There is an easy defence, have an at least 12 character password. 

Not 6 digit passcode.

They are using exploit, but in addition to that they are relying on victims having laughably short passcodes. As soon as you bypass the limit on number of tries 6 digits is nothing.

Edit:

According to the article 6 digit passcode can take up to 3 days, so 12 character password would take probably over decades.

I did a quick test on password strenght tester, and 6 digit passcode gives typically 10 bits of entropy. While 12 char gives around 45 bits.

So 12 char password takes 105553116263424 days longer. Which means that my estimate about years or decades was a bit off. I'd say that universe has ended before 12 char password can be cracked in device in iPhone.

Caution: playing with big numbers can easily lead to mistakes especially while still waking up, but I'd say it takes long enough, as long as attackers cannot export the phone contents and crack on some supercomputer cluster.
